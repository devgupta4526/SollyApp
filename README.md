## üí¨ Frequently Asked Questions

<details open> <summary> When was project Solly started? </summary>  

> üéØ I started working on this idea 6 months before founding `Solly app` (April 2023). The idea was exploring `mental models` + `productivity tips` to achieve your `goals`. I tried to test the idea with `Productivity` & `Time Management Trackers` . So I built `initial MVP`..

</details>

<details> <summary> What is the future goals of this project Einsen? </summary>  
> ü¶Ñ For Future work I will be implementing some new cool features for this application. Here are some of the amazing features you will come to expect from this platform :point_down:

- `Progress Bar` for each task
- `Recurring task`
- `Notes Taking` as per user preference
- `Calendar` based task management
- `Statistics` for completed task
